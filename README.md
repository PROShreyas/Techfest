Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking Project

Objective: Develop a highly accurate and efficient system for detecting, classifying, and tracking multiple objects in real-time, suitable for surveillance, autonomous driving, and retail automation.

Key Features:

1. High detection precision (>90%)
2. Real-time processing (<30ms latency)
3. Object tracking across video frames
4. Robustness to environmental variations (lighting, angles, occlusions)

Technical Approach:

1. AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
2. YOLOv5 for object detection
3. Deep SORT/Kalman filters for tracking
4. Python, Jupyter Notebook, and VS Code

Methodology:

1. Data collection (COCO, Open Images)
2. Image augmentation and normalization
3. Model training (transfer learning, fine-tuning)
4. Optimization (quantization, pruning)

Applications:

1. Surveillance (intrusion detection)
2. Autonomous driving (object classification)
3. Retail automation (product tracking)

Evaluation Metrics:

1. Precision & Recall
2. FPS (Frames per Second)
3. mAP (Mean Average Precision)

Challenges & Solutions:

1. Environmental variations (data augmentation)
2. Occlusions (robust tracking algorithms)
3. Real-time speed (optimization, hardware acceleration)

This project aims to deliver a highly accurate and efficient object detection and tracking system for various real-world applications.
